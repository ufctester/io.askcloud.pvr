The shirts from the \"Green Lantern\" comic book series have a specific color with a corresponding symbol, with each color representing a different corps of heroes or villains (e.g. Red Lanterns, Orange Lanterns, etc). In the comics, each color also represents a specific emotion: Red=Anger, Orange=Greed, Yellow=Fear, Green=Willpower/Courage, Blue=Hope, Indigo=Compassion and Violet=Love. Not surprisingly, the color of shirt Sheldon wears in each scene is often a clue to his mood. These colors are also the exact colors of a real rainbow. The order of colors in a rainbow is easiest to remember by the following mnemonic (a formula that helps one remember something): Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain. R=red, O=orange, Y=yellow, G=green, B=blue, I=indigo, and V=violet.
