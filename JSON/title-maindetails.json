For some of you who may not have seen The Big Bang Factor yet it is a lot like Scrubs if you crank up the geek factor and move the characters from a hospital to a laboratory.\n\nI'm not sure what CBS is doing to promote this series but clearly it is not enough. I heard about this show through a friend and I have never seen a commercial for it ever. I don't know if CBS is trying to keep this show a secret or if their marketing guys just fell asleep at the wheel but this show is fantastic.\n\nThe characters, that seem exaggerated at first, are actually believable if you have ever been to a physics conference of any kindÂ…or for that matter any comic-con. These \"geeks\" make up an ever growing segment of our population and I think it is wonderful that they finally have a show to call their own. Perhaps I am biased because of my own nerd tendencies but I have had arguments exactly like the ones in this show with my own clique of nerdy friends. To anyone who ever enjoyed math class watch this show and get your friends who didn't like math class to watch too because if they get you they will get this show.","user_location":"United States","user_score_count":166},"certificate":{"certificate":"12","attr":"(season 1)"},"has":["trivia","goofs","quotes","more_plot","parentalguide","user_comments","external_reviews","photos"],"creators":[{"name":{"nconst":"nm0521143","name":"Chuck Lorre","image":{"width":1677,"url":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTA1ODYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU4NTQ4NA@@._V1_.jpg","height":2048}},"attr":"(creator)"},{"name":{"nconst":"nm0695080","name":"Bill Prady","image":{"width":1600,"url":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxODY4MzI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjY4NA@@._V1_.jpg","height":1418}},"attr":"(creator)"}],"writers_summary":[{"name":{"nconst":"nm0521143","name":"Chuck Lorre","image":{"width":1677,"url":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTA1ODYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU4NTQ4NA@@._V1_.jpg","height":2048}},"attr":"(creator)"},{"name":{"nconst":"nm0695080","name":"Bill Prady","image":{"width":1600,"url":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxODY4MzI3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjY4NA@@._V1_.jpg","height":1418}},"attr":"(creator)"}],"rating":8.6,"num_votes":125430,"tconst":"tt0898266","genres":["Comedy"],"best_plot":{"outline":"A woman who moves into an apartment next door to two brilliant but socially awkward physicists shows them how little they know about life outside of the laboratory.","total_summaries":1},"quote":{"lines":[{"stage":"repeated line"},{"quote":"Bazinga!","chars":[{"nconst":"nm1433588","char":"Sheldon"}]}],"qconst":"qt1547031"},"can_rate":true,"release_date":{"normal":"2007-09-24"},"trivium":"In fall 2010, Kaley Cuoco revealed to \"CBS Watch!
